# Tailscale on Heroku

Run [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on a Heroku dyno.

## Usage

This is intended to be run as a [second/third/whatever buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app) for an app.  At least, that's how I intend to use it - but I'm new to Heroku, and I favor an experimental approach to learning. so anything could happen.

Looks to be based on https://tailscale.com/kb/1107/heroku/.

Much appeciation to @kongmadai, and anyone else who wrote boilerplate so I don't have to.
Also Tailscale is one of the most impressive projects out there right now, amd not just for what it does.  A constant stream of updates and new features, *really* high quality code, thorough documentation, solid relationship between devs and community, a generous free tier...the list goes on.  The people on that project are kind of making the rest of us look bad.
